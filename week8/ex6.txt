Since the machine has 16-bit virtual address, there are 2^16 addressable "virtual" bytes. If page size is 8 KB = 2^13 bytes, then the whole address space can be divided into maximum of (2^16)/(2^13) = 2^3 = 8 pages, hence a single-level linear page table is needed to have 8 entries. Each entry can consist of 16 bits, where first 3 bits is a page number and other 13 is a page offset (it enables to address any byte within a page, since page consists of 2^13 addressable bytes).
