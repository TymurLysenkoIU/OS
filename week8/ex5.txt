Each process has its own address space represented by a virtual memory. Virtual memory has virtual adresses. But in order for a process to be manipulated (code segment executed or data segment read/modified) by a CPU the process needs to reside in a physical memory, which has its own set of addresses - physical address space. From the processe's point of view, when it references memory (for read or write) it uses its address space - virtual address space, which maps on physical addresses.
